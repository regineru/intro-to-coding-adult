          The
          <code className="dnb-code">data</code> folder holds several files that
          contain data for the online bank, and thus serves like the database in
          this system. There you can see, for example, the list of accounts and
          the associated transactions that are displayed in the table on the
          Customer page. Try to identify these three components in the code:
          <Ul>
            <li>
              The file
              <code className="dnb-code">Models.tsx</code> contains the data
              models. This is not data, but a definition of how the data we will
              have shhould be structured in the database.
            </li>
            <li>
              The file <code className="dnb-code">customer.tsx</code> under{" "}
              <code className="dnb-code">data</code> contains the actual data.
              You see that iy is structured according to the data models, where
              each customer has a name and a list of transactions for example.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <i>Accounts</i> table on the <i>Customer page</i>, found in{" "}

              the data in these files. You see that the list of accounts here is
              the same as in the data file.
            </li>

            As you may have noticed, the button doesn't actually change
            anything. For this we need to implement some logic to the button, so
            that when the button is pressed it will change the
            <code className="dnb-code">card_status</code> of the card to{" "}
            <i>blocked</i>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let's start with the card at the top, and implement logic to the
            button next to it. <br />
            You need to to two things for this to work:
            <Ol>
              <Li>
                Use a state in{" "}
                <code className="dnb-code">&lt;PaymentCard&gt;</code>
              </Li>
              <Li>
                Change the state in{" "}
                <code className="dnb-code">&lt;Switch&gt;</code>
              </Li>
            </Ol>
            In order for one component to be able to change something in another
            component we need to use a state that both of them can use and
            change. A state is created by calling{" "}
            <Anchor

            which you can see we have done three time on line 19, 20 and 21 in{" "}
            <code className="dnb-code">CardOverview.tsx</code>.
            <br />
            <br />
            First we need to use the state (ref. nr. 1 above). This is done
            setting the property <code className="dnb-code">
              card_status
            </code>{" "}
            in <code className="dnb-code">PaymentCard</code> to the state. Let's
            use the first state for the first card. <br />
            <br /> Second (ref. nr. 2 above), we need to change this state when
            the button is pressed. This is done by using the{" "}
            <code className="dnb-code">on_change</code> property in{" "}
            <code className="dnb-code">Switch</code>, and use the function to
            set the state to a new value, which is our case would be{" "}

            for how to do this:{" "}

            button again.
            <br />

            To create this page you can use some layout components to make it
            look similar to the reference image:
            <br />
            <Anchor
              href="https://eufemia.dnb.no/uilib/layout/flex/container/"
              target="_blank"
            >
              FlexContainer
            </Anchor>{" "}
            and{" "}
            <Anchor
              href="https://eufemia.dnb.no/uilib/layout/flex/item/"
              target="_blank"
            >
              FlexItem
            </Anchor>
            <FormStatus
              top
              stretch={true}
              text="Note that FlexContainer is FlexContainer NOT Flex.Container, and FlexItem is FlexItem NOT Flex.Item. It is wrong in the documentation"
              state="warn"
            />
            Use the input values to fill the content of this page.

        hint: (

            Be sure to send with the values from the application form when you
            call <code className="dnb-code">ApplicationResult</code> in{" "}
            <code className="dnb-code">Application.tsx</code> so that you can
            use those values.
            <br />
            <br />
            To create a layout similar to the{" "}
            <Anchor href="/reference_image_application_result" target="_blank">
              Reference image for application summary
            </Anchor>{" "}
            you can adjust the <code className="dnb-code">size</code> of the{" "}
            <code className="dnb-code">FlexItem</code>. One row on a page
            consist of 12 units, which means that if the size of one{" "}
            <code className="dnb-code">FlexItem</code> is 2 like so:{" "}
            <code className="dnb-code">
              &lt;FlexItem size=&#123;2&#125;&gt;
            </code>{" "}
            and another one is 12 like so:
            <code className="dnb-code">
              &lt;FlexItem size=&#123;12&#125;&gt;
            </code>{" "}
            they will make up one row on the page.

            To be able to return back to the previous page (the application form

            To make the application form more secure towards wrong usage, we

            It can be easier here to add a function{" "}

            <br />
            <br />
            Remember that <code className="dnb-code">||</code> is <i>or</i>.
