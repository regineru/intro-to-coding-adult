        <p className="dnb-p">This task covers algorithms. We want to optimize our search method to better handle large amounts of data. Currently we use a built-in search method, but we want to replace this with a new sorting algorithm called Bubble sort. It looks like this:
        <ol>
          <li>Go through each element in the unsorted list using a for loop</li>
          <li>For each item, loop through the remaining list</li>
          <li>Use an if statement to check if the next item is larger</li>
          <li>If it is, swap the items and continue compare with the next.</li>
          <li>When the entire list has been compared, return the list</li>
        </ol>
        Go to Task4/SortringAlgorithm and implement the algorithm using the comments as a guide. Once you have implemented your algorithm you can test it by uncommenting the last line in the file and running:
        <code className="dnb-code">src/code/Task4/SortingAlgorithm.ts</code>
        To use your sorting algorithm, go to _____ and change_______
